![Icon128.png](images/icon128.png)

A simple Chrome extension to convert YouTube short URLs to the full video URLs and optionally auto-redirect.

## Features

- **Instant Redirect**: With just a click, convert the YouTube short URL to its full video URL and stay on the same tab.
- **Open in New Tab**: Want to keep the short URL page and also view the full video? Just use this feature to open the full video URL in a new tab.
- **Auto-Redirect**: Don't want to click every time? Just toggle on the Auto-Redirect feature, and every time you visit a YouTube short URL, the extension will automatically redirect you to the full video URL.
